How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

Built this website from scratch no template was used and made my own templates for different types of articles.

Potential Optimizations

Because the image sizes are of high resolution the load speed is slow would like to increase load speed, would like to hyperlink the tittle to link to home page(unable to lack of time). 


Lessons Learned:
-insert small icon associated with tab 
-the function of title tag 
-formating the img associated when sharing the link 
-learned how to host website
