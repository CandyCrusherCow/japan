                All these books have only one thing in common, they left me feeling confused, befuddled and screaming WTH am I reading.
                Let's explore all the different reasons. Many of the books I read by Japanese authors fit this category and so I chose 
                the ones that are exceptionally eccentric and some may surprise you.
            </p>

            <h3>Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miri</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Tokyo-Ueno-Station-Yu-Miri/dp/1911284169"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613LXclahnL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"></a>
            <p>This book is taken from the view of a homeless man who lives at Ueno Station. I love the concept and learning more 
                about the grimmer side of Japan was fascinating. However, at some points I had no idea what was happening in the book 
                and couldn't tell the difference between reality and imagination. Pick up this book if feeling constantly confused is 
                your thing.

            <h3>The Book of Tea By Okakura Kakuz≈ç</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Book-Tea-Okakura-Kakuzo/dp/0983610606"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492192349i/904538.jpg"></a>
            <p>If you flipped to a random page in this book you would question if the book is really about tea. The book was written in 
                1906, regarding how tea has influenced Japanese culture and how Japanese culture is intertwined with tea.
            </p>
            <p>Just read this quote and you will understand,  ' "How delightfully the fishes are enjoying themselves in the water!" 
                exclaimed Soshi. His friend spake to him thus: "You are not a fish; how do you know that the fishes are enjoying themselves?"
                "You are not myself," returned Soshi; "how do you know that I do not know that the fishes are enjoying themselves?" '.
            </p>
            <p>Pick up this book if you love telling random facts at parties.</p>

            <h3>Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Convenience-Store-Woman-Sayaka-Murata/dp/0802128254"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SsLYe8ZRL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"></a>
            <p> This book is about a woman that works at a convenience store. That is all I knew when starting this book. This is a short novel 
                that is a must read. I thought this book would be about the mundane, a lot of japanese literature loves to find the beauty in the 
                mundane. However, this book will shock you with interesting characters trying to navigate this strange planet. I love this book for 
                how exceptionally odd it is and how it really made me scream WTH.
            </p>
            <p>Pick up this book if you sometimes wonder what a stranger's life is like.</p>

            <h3>In the Miso Soup by Ryu Murakami</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Miso-Soup-Ryu-Murakami/dp/B001OMHVUA"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bloomsbury-atlas/image/upload/w_360,c_scale/jackets/9780747578888.jpg"></a>
            <p>Japan is known for its incredible horror genre. I could not do a reading adventure and not read a Japanese horror story.
            </p>
            <p>In the miso soup is about a Japanese private tour guide that takes on an American client to show him up close and personal the sex 
                industry in Japan. Then things take a major turn. This book is incredibly written, and covers how the sex industry works, major 
                flaws of Japan and the perception of Americans in Japan. I learned so much from this book, and I really wanted to finish this book. 
                Although I knew what I was getting into (some graphic scenes and such), I was not prepared for what I read and it's not an understatement 
                saying it still haunts me to this day. Pick up this book if you want flashbacks to scenes of this book making you never want to talk 
                about it again.
