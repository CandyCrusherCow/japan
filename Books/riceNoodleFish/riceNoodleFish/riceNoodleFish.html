            <p>
                This book is made for everyone,are you looking for inspiration, 
                planning on traveling to Japan, or just curiosity. It's a beautiful exploration of Japan itself through its
                food and an amazing tool I recommend to anybody interested in Japanese food culture. Japanese food culture is 
                also deeply intertwined with the general societal culture and the ways Japanese perceive life. If you're convinced
                already to read then I recommend just diving right in, however if you need a little more convincing continue reading!
            </p>
            <p>This was one of the last books I read in preparation for my trip to Japan, and I definitely saved the best for last. 
                As someone who spends most of my money on food, I was thoroughly looking forward to the food in Japan. Japanese food 
                culture is so essential to Japanese society, food makes impactful appearances in movies, manga and books. One of the 
                biggest reasons I had been so excited for the food has been how delicious it looks in anime. I wanted a book that 
                offered more detailed insight into Japanese cuisine, the history of its long lasting cultural impact and maybe what 
                it says about Japan's identity as a whole. All while keeping me interested. This is an incredibly large request thus 
                very hard to find. However after reading the introduction I knew I found the right book.

            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>Structure is not something I usually rave about in a book, however this book is brilliantly structured. 
                It is first sectioned off by location, each section dedicated to different areas of Japan of course starting 
                in Tokyo. It makes it so easily accessible if you would only like to learn about the food culture of where 
                you're visiting. At the time I started the book I had already planned the majority of my trip, I was honestly 
                surprised that some of the more remote places were mentioned in the book. Maybe I’m naive but the majority of 
                other guidebooks that I had read previously really only focused on places to eat in Tokyo and Osaka. Seeing other 
                places made me ecstatic to have some insight about what to eat and look for when I visited Hiroshima, Fukuoka and 
                others! There is also a structured breakdown of each section, starting off with personal stories, history of the 
                area. Followed by informative infographics of various topics. The very last portion of each section is my favorite, 
                even if you skip a whole chapter you should not skip this section. Some of the most useful information presented as 
                a picture essay (quick shout out to having reference images that brought stories to life); images followed by short 
                informative paragraphs. This section covers many questions I had for Japan, like what is good to get from a vending 
                machine to what is good to eat at the convenience store. The structure is perfect. it starts by convincing you how 
                amazing the food is, then provides practical information as well! The more time that has gone past since reading the 
                book the more appreciation I have for the structure of the book. 
            </p>

            <h3>Style of Writing </h3>
            <p>If the structure hasn't convinced you that this a masterpiece the writing will, I don’t even think my writing 
                could do the book justice. I was absolutely hooked moments into reading the book. This book is written so casually 
                that it feels as if you’re talking to a friend who is really good at describing food. With the ease of conversation 
                and writing the ignites of sense you feel that you're in the book talking to the chefs yourself. The only word that 
                describes the writing is delicious.
            </p>
            <p>Matt pokes fun at himself fully aware that he is someone looking in from the outside. His candidness is extremely 
                refreshing, for people that love food but may not consider themselves experts or connoisseurs. Hearing about chefs 
                that bend over backwards to get a single perfect dish can sometimes baffle you, you start to think ‘are they crazy’ or 
                ‘am I just not getting it’. The author seemingly breaks the fourth wall and voices some of these opinions himself which 
                only makes the book more grounded and humble in a way that I find charming. This aspect of the book made me love the 
                book more, it really felt like a friend giving opinions and advice rather than someone selling me a fantasy.

            <h3>Restaurant Recommendations</h3>
            <p> Once I got to Japan I didn’t realize how much I would actually reference the book. I wanted to see if the book's 
                restaurant recommendations were as good as the author made them sound. He listed a lot of restaurants, some completely 
                out of my budget range or in far off locations. However, I managed to go to three restaurants, all three restaurants 
                had over an hour wait. The first restaurant I went to was a ramen shop located in a subway station near Imperial palace 
                in Tokyo. I made sure that we got what was recommended by the book. The food was incredible and I am so glad that we 
                found this place because it is overwhelming the amount of food options in Japan. The second place we tried was 
                Yagenbori Hasshō, an Okonomiyaki restaurant located in Hiroshima. A wonderful experience and delicious! Last but not 
                least we made a stop at Hakata station to Try Shin Shin Ramen. I can not recommend these restaurants enough, they are 
                definitely worth the wait.

            <h3>Overall Thoughts </h3>
            <p> This book was everything I wanted and more! The book is humorous, candid, interesting, saturated with knowledge and 
                best of all will make you want to eat your way through Japan. The inspiring set up makes you want to eat everywhere, 
                while also making it easy to reference. With poetic writing describing every sensation it will feel like you are 
                sitting right beside him. To top it off, so much insight into incredible restaurants, types of food, ways to eat, 
                cultural impact and general knowledge. What can I say? It's a sensational book that gives you a whole set of tools to 
                prepare you for Japan. All wrapped up in this perfect book that won’t bore you to death.
            </p>
            <p>My only criticism of the book but this is a criticism of any book of this nature is that as soon as it's published it 
                can be out of date, I say this because the amount of time for him to have these experiences, write them down, edit, 
                push to editors, things have already changed. New restaurants have appeared, old ones have closed down, cultural 
                landscapes have changed and so on. Looking up some of the restaurants in the book some have closed or the chefs have 
                moved locations and so on. I knew I wouldn't be able to try everything in this book but I wanted to have the same 
                magical experiences as the author had! Don’t get me wrong this book offers way more than just restaurant 
                recommendations, and is still a must read for going to Japan. Honestly there aren't many books that are this well 
                written, immersive and informative about this particular subject. There's lots of books on each specific subject 
                covered in this book but none that really compare overall from my research. 
            </p>
            <p>This book found me at the perfect place and time. I read it right before Japan, gave fantastic restaurant 
                recommendations and hyped me up to go to Japan. I would recommend this book to anyone planning on going to Japan, 
                can’t afford to go but loves food and anyone craving a delicious read.
