            <p>
                Reading is a magical experience, you can escape into new worlds, travel aross the globe and expereience things
                unimaginable. Before starting my plan to Japan I had litle to no knowledge of Japan. I knew it was home to some
                of my favorite food and some anime my boyfriend made me watch. I knew there was so much to discover before even 
                arriving in Japan. I wanted to know what people grew up eating, what it would be like to be born in Japan, or born 
                in Japan during the 17th century. How are there social construsts, how are they different from our own. Every book 
                I read whether I like it or not added to this idea of what it meant to be in Japan and really appreciate it. 
            </p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite books that I have read about Japan.</p>

            <h3>I Think Our Son is Gay by Okura</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Think-Our-Son-Gay-01/dp/1646090926"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91FF33tfGyL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"></a>
            <p>Manga is the perfect place for light-hearted easy and fun reads. A lot of Japanese litature is heavy and dark.
            Don't be afraid to dive into manga I promise there is somthing for everyone. I think our son is gay is slice of life 
            manga that brings you into the world of what it might be like to be gay in modern Japan. The book does not take itself to 
            seriously and has lot of funny moments. I slowly became invested in each characters stories and can't wait for more 
            from this author.

            <h3>Kimi Ni Todoke by Karuho Shiina</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Kimi-Todoke-Me-You-Vol-ebook/dp/B00FDZJ1CK"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rsjJvXMsL.jpg"></a>
            <p>This is a sugar sweet manga set in highschool. About a shy misunderstood girl that comes off as weird and catches
                the eye of the most popular boy in school. I read this as a teenager so I might be biased but I could not get enough 
                of there love story. If you are into corny highschool romances this is a must read.
            </p>

            <h3>Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Convenience-Store-Woman-Sayaka-Murata/dp/0802128254"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SsLYe8ZRL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"></a>
            <p> When I first saw this book I had little to no interest in the book. As someone who has worked my fair share
                of customer service facing jobs I felt that this books just wouldn't intrigue me. Slowly I saw this book every where, I
                believe it's on every reccomened Japanese litature list I read. After reading it, it all makes sense, its is immaculately
                written, with incredible charcaters and storylines. I was hooked from the moment I started reading it and it's an absolute 
                must read from this list.

            <h3>Every Day a Good Day:<br> Fifteen Lessons I learned about hapiness from Japanese tea Culture by Noriko Morishita</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Wisdom-Tea-Lessons-Japanese-Ceremony/dp/1911630636"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1555831224i/45186010.jpg"></a>
            <p> I've always had a fascination with Japanese tea ceremony and the intricacies of the artform. This book was everything
                I wanted and more. Gave insight to societies perception of tea ceremony in the modern world, gave a first person 
                expereience of what it is like to learn how to perform a tea ceremony all while intertwining interesting personal stories. 
                I would not reccomend this as any sort of self help book, but I would absolutley reccomend to fellow tea lovers and others 
                intrigued by tea ceremonies and japanese culture.

            <h3>Comrade Loves of the Samurai by Saikaku Ihara</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Comrade-Loves-Samurai-Saikaku-Ihara/dp/0804810249"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364137804i/1025337.jpg"></a>
            <p> Originally published in 1687 absolutley makes this the oldest publication on this list. I would take this into consideration 
                when reading this book. Despite that I whole heartedly love this book, it is composed of short stories that are filled with 
                love, passion, friendship, betrayal, and heartache. I love this novel so much I will be purchasing another book by him for 
                my trip!

            <h3>Autobiography of a Geisha Sayo Masuda</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Geisha-Sayo-Masuda/dp/0231129513"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388233863i/70048.jpg"></a>
            <p>An incredibly eye opening memoir about the trials and tribulations of growing up in poverty in Japan. This is an very raw account
                from the source herself about her life. The pain and suffering I felt through her words have been unmatched by any other. At times
                I could not believe that this was based on someones life. Learning about her life, family and friendship was beautiful and I am so 
                appreciative that the author was able to share her story.
