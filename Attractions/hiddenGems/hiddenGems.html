            <h1>Hidden Gems of Japan</h1>
            <span>Written by Babbling Gaijin</span>

            <p>Japan has so many different landscapes and cultures, there is so much more to explore!. 
            </p>
            <p>Based on personal experience these were my favourite places to visit that were less crowded. </p>

            <h3>Tokyo: Jimbōchō station</h3>
            <p>I only found out about this place because I read a book about it, despite all my research it never came up. Jimbocho is 
                the largest collection of second hand book stores in the world. I would recommend going there after 10am. Each store is 
                dedicated to a different genre. If you're lucky you may chat to a bookstore owner about their bookstore! Jimbocho 
                offers lots of stationary stores, coffee shops and pastry shops. It's my literal heaven.

            <a href=""><img src="bamboo.jpg"></a>
            <h3>Tokyo: Roka Koshun-en Gardens</h3>
            <p>This is the first garden we visited in Japan. The main reason we went there was for the bamboo garden. 
                This little gem in the city is where I got some fantastic and beautiful shots in the bamboo garden. Although 
                it is very small, upon arrival nobody was there and we got to enjoy it all by ourselves. A little bonus was 
                a historical house that is maintained. Best part was it was free and empty. 
            </p>

            <a href=""><img src="thrift.jpg"></a>
            <h3>Tokyo: Shimokitazawa(thrift store district)</h3>
            <p> This may be one of the busier Gems in the lot depending on where and when you start, but it was definitely my 
                favorite. If you love thrifting this is definitely the place to go! 
            </p>

            <a href=""><img src="buddha.jpg"></a>
            <h3>Tokyo: Ushiku Daibutsu</h3>
            <p> This is 2hrs away(by transit) from the city centre. It's the largest Buddha statue in Japan and was absolutely gorgeous. 
                We got there first thing in the morning and nobody was there.  You can enter the statue (no shoes allowed) to see some 
                wonderful exhibits inside.

        <section class="bookList">
            <a href=""><img src="takayamOnsen.jpg"></a>
            <h3>Takayama</h3>
            <p> This little onsen town completely stole my heart. In the middle of nowhere we landed at our hotel in the middle of 
                the mountains. Fantastic for a romantic getaway from the city life/ crowds. The views are breathtaking. If you want

        <section class="bookList">
            <a href=""><img src="goldenHands.jpg"></a>
            <h3>Kyoto:Rengeoin Sanjusangendo</h3>
            <p>This national treasure is still a hidden treasure in Japan. Way less crowded compared to its counterparts Inari shrine, 
                and nijo castle. We almost skipped this one because our schedule was so packed, but so glad we didn't because it was 
                the highlight of our day. No cameras allowed and the golden statues are insanely beautiful.

            <a href=""><img src="yakushima.jpg"></a>
            <h3>Yakushima </h3>
            <p> Many of the islands off Japan seem extraordinary. However, I was entranced by yakushima. It looked like a magical 
                place forged in a fantasy novel. It was incredible and extremely far which is why so few go there. If you want to 
                know more <a href="/Attractions/yakushima/yakushima.html">click here.</a>
