            <p>Based on my trip in Tokyo these are places I dream about and constantly yearn to go back to. If you are interested in any of the restaurants click the image, and save it on your Google Maps!</p>

            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shinjuku+Haruta-ya/@35.6929173,139.6994735,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188cd9f041afad:0xe2ceaea7632500bd!8m2!3d35.692913!4d139.7020484!16s%2Fg%2F1v0lks84?entry=ttu"><img src="/Food/images/Shinjuku Haruta-ya.jpg" alt="Bowl of Ramen from Shinjuku Haruta-ya"></a>
            <h3>Shinjuku Haruta-ya</h3>
            <p>We stumbled upon this place while exploring Shinjuku. It seemed popular with locals so we thought we would give it a try. It's a standing yakitori place with cheap food, beer, and many options. I loved the pork belly skewers, chicken tail skewers and summer corn dish. If you are feeling adventurous but don't want to spend a lot this is a perfect place to explore.</p>

            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rokurinsha/@35.6800635,139.7652716,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60188bfbd91993eb:0x73e0693562fc525a!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188bfeba8313b7:0x9a9993c592e5429c!8m2!3d35.6800592!4d139.7678465!16s%2Fg%2F1thlzfdx?entry=ttu"><img src="/Food/images/Rokurinsha.jpg" alt="Rokuinsha, Ramen Alley"></a>
            <h3>Rokurinsha</h3>
            <p>This Ramen shop is located in the train station! Rokurinsha specializes in dip noodles, which have thicker noodles and a curry base broth. Despite the hefty wait time of an hour and a half mid-day, the portions are massive and delicious!
            </p>
            <p>Pro Tip: Finding this place was hard, we tried to navigate the underground train station with little to no directions. But, If you follow the signs to the JR exit you will soon find a mini-mall connected to the mall a place called Ramen Avenue where they have clustered several Ramen shops including this one.</p>

            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E3%81%A8%E3%82%93%E3%81%BC%E3%82%84+Tonboya/@35.6660056,139.7699971,21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188b0b59dc5ec5:0xeed7cb84f9c22a5e!8m2!3d35.6660342!4d139.770192!16s%2Fg%2F11jh7nd32h?entry=ttu"><img src="/Food/images/TsukijiFishMarket1.jpg" alt="Tsukiji fish Market"></a>
            <h3>Tsukiji Fish Market</h3>
            <p>The food here is incredible if you know where to go! We had everything from Wagyu beef, grilled eel, fresh-cut tuna, torched tuna, raw scallops and so much more. The Market has the freshest fish and most delicious sushi. A trip here wouldn't be complete without grilled eel. I was never a fan of grilled eel before, but here it just melts in your mouth and is marvelous! 
            </p>
            <img src="/Food/images/TsukijiFishMarket2.jpg" alt="Tsukiji fish Market">
            <p>This place is massive and overwhelming. Thus, this is one of the few places that I heavily recommend getting a tour guide. I honestly was hesitant about getting a guide however upon arriving at the market was very thankful we had one! "Tsukiji Private Tour: Eat Every Street Food & See Everything", I loved this tour because no food was included so the guide would take you to the best places and you could decide what you wanted instead of having a pre-planned menu. I am not a picky eater, however, I have a small appetite. So this kind of tour is perfect for me. Best of all, since this was a private tour, the guide tailored the itinerary to our interests and preferences. After experiencing the tour we went again without a guide and were extremely lost and tried food that wasn't the greatest so the tour was worth it! 
            </p>
            <p>P.S. While there I tried documenting all the amazing places we ate at the fish market but not much of it is documented online and all the names are in Japanese. The only restaurant I can find was a torched Tuna place named Tonboya</p>

            <h3>馳走 風々（ちそう ふふ</h3>
            <p>Kaiseki is a whole segment of its own. This restaurant was a splendid fine dining experience. We had everything from grilled salmon to sashimi of fish I didn't even know existed. The food was sensational but what made the experience special was the people. Although none of the staff spoke any English they were very accommodating in trying to explain everything using pictures and Google Translate. In the intimate restaurant, we were the only people in there. This was an astounding experience that I will always treasure.
            </p>

            <h3>Ramen Tatsunoya Shinjuku</h3>
            <p>We visited this ramen shop in Japan, and it was the first and last place we ate at during our trip. Despite having to wait for an hour, which seemed to be the norm no matter what time we went, we can confidently say that it was one of the best ramen shops we visited in Japan.
            </p>
            <p>The majority of the restaurants we visited in Tokyo were only good enough for one visit. However, this particular restaurant was so delicious that we ate there three times during our six-day stay.
            </p>
            <p>Don't forget about dessert. The pudding is so creamy I didn't even think a ramen shop could nail ramen and dessert but you're missing out if you don't get dessert.</p>
            <p>Ramen is one of the least expensive meals you can get in Japan, for this price it's a mind-blowing experience.</p>

            <h3>Little Bakery Shinjuku</h3>
            <p>We mostly went to convenience stores for breakfast but the last few days we found this bakery that we just adored. They had a large assortment of buns, doughnuts and sandwiches. My personal favourite was a flaky doughnut that was filled with Taro paste.
